388. Longest Absolute File Path
Intuition
Directories has a hierarchy type of relation, so we can use stack to simulate the process.
Explanations
For each dir or file, we store 3 things in stack
current total length (including parent and '/'), depth (how many '\t' to reach this subdir)
If stack is empty, we add new tuple
If deepest dir or file in stack (stack[-1]) is at the same or deeper depth of current path
pop stack until stack[-1] (or empty stack) is shallower than depth of path
Add tuple and cumulate the total length
If name has . then it's a file path and we can compare it with ans to get the longest.
Implementation
